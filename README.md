# **The World of Hedonia**
On New Year's Eve, I made a wish to immerse myself forever in the sensations that I experienced while taking tranquilizers. I wanted to fall into a sweet sleep and not face reality anymore. In an effort to forget myself, I was trapped in a depressive hedonia, which Mark Fisher described in "Capitalist Realism" as an inability to do anything other than the search for pleasure.

In this series, I depict different types of pleasures and the states associated with them. I create still lifes and environments from objects and substances that are associated with something pleasant and seductive, and sometimes creepy. The doll appears to be my alter-ego, living a New Year's experiment.
